Crypto portfolio analyzer

Background:
This crypto porfolio analyzer allows you to input information about your cryptocurrency purchases, namely the coin, amount, and date of purchase.  It uses the information to generate a visualization of the portfolio.  

Functionality: 
Users will be able to: 
1. Search for and select a wide range of cryptos to add to their portfolio
2. Click a point on a line graph showing historical price as a way of inputting purchase date.  
3. Click on pieces of a pie chart to display all information about particular pieces of the portfolio.    
4. Use a profit calculator to see how much they will make after selling at a particular price.  

This project will also include: 
1. instructions 
2. readme 
3. links to my github, linked in, and personal website 

Libraries and Apis: 
1. D3 will be used to render the data visualizations.  
2. The coingecko API will be used for fetching the necessary data 

Implementation Timeline: 

Friday afternoon and the weekend: 
Set up the general project structure and make sure the data is effectively being pulled from the API and parsed  to be used with the app.  Do general styling for the project.  Implement the search for coins and add to portfolio functionality.  Try to get started with charting and using D3.    

Monday: 
I'll work with D3 and render data the way I want it to.  

Tuesday: 
I'll add interactivity to the charts

Wednesday: 
Continue with D3 to add any additional functionality, then fix any existing bugs, and clean up the UI if time permits. 

Thursday morning: 
Deploy to github pages or heroku.
